This project involves developing a vehicle tracking system using the YOLO (You Only Look Once) object detection model. The system processes video footage to detect vehicles and tracks them across frames. By utilizing a tracking algorithm, the system assigns unique IDs to each detected vehicle, allowing for consistent tracking throughout the video. The results are displayed in real-time, with the tracked vehicles marked by circles at their centers and labeled with their corresponding IDs. This project has potential applications in traffic monitoring and automated surveillance systems
